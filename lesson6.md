## Overview
Lighthouse is an open-source, automated tool for helping you to imrpove the performance, quality, and correctness of your web apps. 

When auditing a page, Lighthouse runs a barrage of tests against the page, and then generates a report on how well the page did. From here you can use the failing tests as indicators on what you can do to improve your app.
